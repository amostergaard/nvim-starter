# Neovim Starter

Minimal working configuration for Neovim's LSP client + nvim-cmp.

The following language servers are configured:

* tsserver
* eslint
* cssls
* html

## Requirements

* Neovim v0.8 or greater.
* git.
* [tsserver](https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server). Typescript language server.
* [vscode-langservers-extracted](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vscode-langservers-extracted). Provides language servers for `eslint`, `css` and `html`.
* [npm cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm). Javascript package manager.
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/es/). Javascript runtime. Required by the language servers.

> Here's the config [compatible with v0.7](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/ca6e3dcc8bab3e21a1971549aee45bc7ca53dd4d). 

## Installation

* Backup your existing configuration if you have one.

* Create an `init.lua` file in your system. Use this command if you don't know the specific location of Neovim's configuration folder.

```sh
nvim --headless -c 'call mkdir(stdpath("config"), "p") | exe "edit" stdpath("config") . "/init.lua" | write | quit'
```

* Open your configuration file with Neovim.

```sh
nvim -c 'edit $MYVIMRC'
```

* Copy the content of `init.lua` in this repository into your own `init.lua`.

* Next time you start Neovim all plugins will be downloaded automatically. After plugins are downloaded restart Neovim.

### Plugins directory

Your plugins will be installed in a separate directory from your configuration. The location of this directory depends on your operating system and environment variables, so you'll need to execute this command to know where that is.

```sh
nvim --headless -c 'echo stdpath("data") . "/lazy/lazy.nvim" | quit'
```
